#Criminal Intent
Criminal Intent allows you to track petty crimes. You can choose suspects from your contacts, mark them solved or requiring police investigation, and can send a text report of the crime details.

This app introduces a number of concepts including RecyclerViews, Fragments, paging, Constraint Layouts, Dialogs, alternative views for tablets/large devices, Menus, SQLite, integrating phone features such as the Camera, Contacts, and sharing app information through text applications. It also demonstrates localization features, gestures such as swiping items to dismiss them or reorder them in a list or to switch pages, and using accessibility features like TalkBack.

It covers chapters 7-19 of the Android Programming: The Big Nerd Ranch Guide 3rd Ed.
